# Team Page Generator

## Description
A command line utility to generate a styled HTML page with information about employees that was entered by the user.

## Usage
* In the command line, navigate to the directory containing the project.
* Run the project by entering 'node index.js'.
* Answer the inquirer prompts to enter manager, engineer, and intern information.
* Once you select 'no more employees', the output HTML page named 'index.HTML' should appear in the 'output' folder in the project.
